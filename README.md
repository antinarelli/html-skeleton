## How-to

This project comes with some grunt tools configured. Some of them are:

### [Grunt YUI Compressor](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/grunt-yui-compressor)
The Grunt YUI Compressor minify all js and css files in your folders in the **assets** directory.

### [Grunt contrib Concat](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-concat)
The Grunt contrib concat (as the name says), concatenates all js and css files in your folders in the **assets** directory.

### [Grunt watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch)
This feature serves to perform all other tasks to verify any change in any file in the folders listed in `gruntfile.js` file. Just run the `grunt watch` command and start working!

**Obs:** To execute css or js tasks separately (concat and minify), just run `grunt css` for css files or `grunt js` for js files.
